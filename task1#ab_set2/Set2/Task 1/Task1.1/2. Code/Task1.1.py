    code here for saving the Aruco image as a "jpg" by following the steps below:
    1. save the image as a colour RGB image in OpenCV color image format
    2. embed a boundary of 25 pixels on all four sides and three channels of the image
    3. save the image as "ArUcoID.jpg" where ID is the digits of id_aruco i.e. if the ID is 26 the name should be: ArUco26.jpg
    4. APIs which are permitted to be used are:
    a. cvtColor
    b. imwrite
    and other OpenCV APIs.
    5. You are permitted to modify n, C and variables id_aruco and num_pixels
